# 6907 Applied ML

## Tasks

- [x] Related work (differ from previous work): current SOTA models and previous work on this task
- [x] Research Question Format: Challenges -> How to solve
- [x] Read papers about Transformer, Vit variants, and EEG data
- [x] Come up some IDEAs! (by 10.7)

- [ ] Download the datset
- [ ] Preprocess the data
- [ ] Reproduce "Vit2EEG" paper with small samples, which helps us understand the dataset

## Step by step

### Part 1

- [x] Read papers about Transformer, Vit variants
- [x] Figure out challenges in EEG dataset (EEGEyeNet gaze position)
- [x] Now we have our research question: How to address xxx challenge in EEG dataset?

### Part 2

- [x] Think about this question: Transformers -> strengths, weaknesses, and potential applications
- [ ] How to apply Transformer to this dataset?
- [ ] Now we have our proposed method
